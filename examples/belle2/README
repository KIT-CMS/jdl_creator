The BELLE 2 software needs special software. These software is supported by the
HTCondor batch system with a docker image. This image runs only on resources 
which has "ProvidesBELLE2".

The python script create_jdl.py creates a directory for the JDL file, the 
executable and subdirecotries for log,error and output files.

Change in the create_jdl.py file the arguments, executable and requerments for
your job and run than the script.

In this example the job run the bash script job.sh. This script can setup your
software and start it.

Switch in the directory with the JDL file. There you can submit your jobs with 
"condor_submit JDL..."

With "condor_q (your username)" you can see the status of your jobs
